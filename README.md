# Bayes-Classifier
A Bayesian classifier is based on the idea that the role of a (natural) class
is to predict the values of features for members of that class. Examples are
grouped in classes because they have common values for the features. Such
classes are often called natural kinds. In this section, the target feature cor-
responds to a discrete class, which is not necessarily binary.
